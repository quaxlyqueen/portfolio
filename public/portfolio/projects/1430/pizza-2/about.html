		<p class="info">Ashton Pizzeria opened it's doors May 25, 2001.
				Family-owned, Ashton Pizzeria was the stomach-child of Josh Ashton.
				Working hard with his parents, Richard and Tracy, the trio spent years prior to the grand opening cultivating 
					and perfecting recipes for the pizzeria.
				
				<br><br>

				The Ashton's have a long history with pizza, with regularly made homemade pizzas each week.
				Pizza wasn't just a food for the Ashton's: it was a lifestyle.
				The Ashton's truly believe that everyone is happier when they have some pizza.

				<br><br>

				The next step was to make pizza as accessible as possible to anyone.
				Not some frozen or processed pizza one finds at <span id="strike">Little Caesar's</span> other pizzeria's,
					but true artisanal pizza made fresh for each customer.

				<br><br>

				We're still making pizza after 20 years, and our family will continue to make pizza for the next 20 years!
