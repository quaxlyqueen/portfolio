This project challenged me to think critically about the existing positions that I have regarding safe firearm storage, and to communicate those thoughts with data and clear speech. Part of why I chose this topic was because of my experience as the Political Director for March for our Lives Arizona, a youth-led gun violence prevention organization in which I advocated for the principles and policy agenda I write about. I enjoyed this assignment fully, and it acted as part of the push towards my own personal enjoyment of writing when paired with the Rhetorical Analysis Essay for ENGL 1010.",

          text: "Solving related rates problems involves a systematic approach: first, identifying the variables that are changing and how they are related, then setting up equations that describe these relationships. After that, differentiation with respect to time is used to relate the rates of change. A common challenge I encountered was ensuring that all terms in the equation were differentiated correctly. When I stumbled on a particularly tricky problem, I revisited the relationships and diagrams, which helped clarify the dependencies between the variables. Completing this assignment deepened my understanding of how different rates of change interact, enhancing my problem-solving skills. Iâ€™m curious to explore the application of related rates within graph data structures, but similarly they seem very applicable to networking in computer science. If we have two rates, the number of active users and the amount of data being sent and received, those two rates could be used to identify the rate with which an increase in users increases data. Given that related rate, this would serve as a useful metric in optimizing server-side code, as the goal would be to lower that rate. Having this knowledge would allow me to write it into a test function, so every time I make a change to my code it calculates the related rate of data per user.",

          text: "In tackling optimization problems, Iâ€™ve learned that a systematic approach is essential. Drawing diagrams and identifying variables helps clarify the relationships between different elements of the problem. In this assignment, I utilized key formulas related to perimeter and area, specifically for a Norman window. However, I encountered challenges in deriving the equations and ensuring accuracy in my calculations. When my initial attempts at finding the maximum area didnâ€™t yield plausible results, I revisited my derivatives, which allowed me to pinpoint errors in my algebra. This iterative process taught me the value of double-checking each step. One key insight I gained was the importance of translating real-world scenarios into mathematical terms, which enhances problem-solving skills. A contrasting real-world optimization problem in computer science is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the goal is to determine the shortest route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the origin. This problem is crucial in logistics and transportation, as optimizing delivery routes can significantly reduce costs and improve efficiency. Understanding TSP emphasizes how optimization techniques are vital not only in theoretical contexts but also in practical applications that affect everyday business operations.",
